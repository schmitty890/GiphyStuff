# GiphyStuff

GiphyStuff reads in an ajax call from https://developers.giphy.com

There is a list of buttons on the top where you can filter new giphs.

You can also add buttons by submitting from a search form on the right side of a topic of your choice. Then click the topic and giphs will load.

Additionally, you can click the like button on each giph. This adds it to a slick.js carousel underneath the form. The slick.js carousel displays 2 slides at a time, and slides 2 slides at a time.

Local storage is used to populate the slick.js carousel if the user clicks on the heart and likes the gif.

Documentation on slick.js is found here - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
